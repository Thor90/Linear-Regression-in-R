<h1> Regression-in-R </h1>

The general assumptions of linear regression:

1. Relationship between yi and xi is linear.
2. Homoscedasticity, varaince of yi is constant across values of xi.
3. Residuals are normally distributed in a population.
4. IV x is measured without error.
5. Residuals for any two individuals in a population are assumed to be independent of one anohter (but often violated, see HLM in R).

The purpose of doing this repository is to demonstrate regression by using <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a>.
